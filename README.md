# ACT Hydro Lab REU (2025) Code
*An investigation into runoff ratios in a warming Arctic using climate models for the Alaska region*

## Introduction
This repository contains the code I (Nathaniel Flores) wrote as a part of the [ACT Hydro lab](https://acthydro.com) during the summer of 2025. Each folder contains code loosely of a different category with its own `README.md`. You are encouraged to read each of them as they contain important information on how to run and extend this code. 

To get started, you'll want to set up your `conda` environment, which you can do by running the following command:
```shell
$ conda env create --file utils/hydro-environment.yaml
```
Then activate the `hydro-env` environment. 

Most subdirectories also contain `Makefile`s that can help you run them faster.

## Improvements
- Need to update Python environment to Python 10
- Actually write the Makefiles out
- Need to write per-section documentation.

## License
All code is MIT licensed.
